# Gab
Gab is a chatbot I made using ChatGPT, the HuggingFace transformers library, Flask, and HTML. Microsoft's DialoGPT-small is the backend model in current use, but I may swap out another at some point and tune that one. I've been curious about Large Language Models and neural nets for some time. After ChatGPT was released, I thought it might be a fun project to use it to see if I could essentially use a chatbot to make a chatbot. I'm still continuing to finetune the hyperparameters using the HuggingFace API so please forgive some of the bot's loopiness. To run, place the templates folder within your python file directory. Create a virtualenv and install the necessary dependencies, or do so directly from the command line, and run the python file. Once it's up, copy and paste the output port into a new tab in your browser and start gabbing!
